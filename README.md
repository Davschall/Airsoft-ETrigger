# Airsoft-ETrigger
Just mucking about learning Arduino. Using this as a way to manage workflow between multiple computers.
If anyone is unfortunate enough to stumble across this, I am a first year engineering student who loves embedded electronics. Until I learn how to design circuits, I am using an arduino to have easy access to a microcontroller. 
Eventually I want to turn this into a board, with an atmel attiny85 at its heart.
I want to create an open source fairly easy to make, low cost, airsoft ETrigger unit. 
I came up with the idea when researching and coming across a few on the market with most being more than $100.
Since this will hopefully add to my portfolio, Im going to document, design, code, and then release it...
hopefully in a reasonable amount of time.

Starting out with semi only, as it is for my dmr, but will add select fire as I get the components.

I am going to start putting this out there soon, so it should be mentioned the project has gotten away from me somewhat, it was supposed to be easy to make but I decided to make everything surface mount for easy of layout, which I realize creates a barrier for some in terms of soldering, its unfortunate but necessary. I've also realized that there are some similar options out there(that are very much better Im sure) for around the same price this can be built(or less) and thats alright as well, I'm not trying to make a product I'm trying to learn and if other people want to learn as well, hopefully this can be an avenue...I am also using non-mmechanical switching(hall effect sensors) which I believe will be much better long term, but we will see, as I dont have actually have a board made yet...I will make this into a real readme some day...for now its just me talking to myself...publicly...its wierd I know.
