# Airsoft-ETrigger
Just mucking about learning Arduino. Using this as a way to manage workflow between multiple computers.
If Anyone is unfortunate enough to stumble across this, I am a first year engineering student who loves embedded electronics. Until I learn
how to design circuits, I am using an arduino to have easy access to a microcontroller. 
Eventually I want to turn this into a board, with an atmel attiny85 at its heart.
I want to create an open source fairly easy to make, low cost, airsoft ETrigger unit. 
I came up with the idea when researching and coming across a few on the market with most being more than $100.
Since this will hopefully add to my portfolio, Im going to document, design, code, and then realease it...
hopefully in a reasonable amount of time.

Starting out with semi only, as it is for my dmr, but will add select fire as I get the components.
